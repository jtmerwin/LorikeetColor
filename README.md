Scripts and Code for Merwin et al., 2018 (presubmission)

To run code, clone the entire directory. Open the .rproj and run "runmefirst.R" This will compile the included functions. 
the "runmefirst.R" package will walk through the steps of the analysis and generate figures. Beware, as some of these functions will take a long time to run, and contain many dependencies.
